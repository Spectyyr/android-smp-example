Campaigns
------
This app showcases how to use SessionM SDK to fetch promotional campaign messages for presentation in an activity feed.

API docs: https://mmc.sessionm.com/docs/mmc-sdk/#campaigns

By default it uses the anonymous user. You can click on “Click Here To Login User” to login the default sample user to see the customized activity feed.

A message tile can be clicked to showcase its associated action (e.g. presenting an ad or opening a web page in native browser).

There are three different actions to trigger different types of feed message: Open ad, deep link and external link. Click on any of the tiles gives you different actions:

- Open Ad: Opens a pre-set Ad in the app’s portal.
